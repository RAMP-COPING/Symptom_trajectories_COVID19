  Depression symptoms in RAMP and COPING April 2020 - April 2021: Linear Growth Curve
  With pairwise correlations

  DATA:
    	FILE IS "//Users/kirstin/Dropbox/SGDP/RAMP/Projects/LongitudinalCommon/

  ANALYSIS:


  	type = twolevel random;
  	ESTIMATOR = MLR; !Maximum lifelihood with robust standard errors
